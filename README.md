# Clin : A smart cli code runner 

-----------------------------------
A stupid project to try out a new language (go btw)

It is not that impractical if you are a student learning c, cpp, or java and don't use vscode with code-runner|
this is a simple simple tool that does it for you in just one step

### Issues
java is not fully supported
no support for build flags
and many more
